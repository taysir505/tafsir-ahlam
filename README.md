A vision is what a person sees in his sleep, and the vision is not narrated to anyone other than a scholar or advisor, for he said what Al-Tirmidhi narrated from the hadith of Abu Hurairah - may God be pleased with him - the saying of the Prophet - may God bless him and grant him peace -: ((The vision is only told by a scholar or advisor) ); recited by Al-Termethy, and corrected by Al-Albani; Because the vision is on the foot of a bird unless it is expressed, and if it is expressed it falls.


And it is not narrated by those who saw it against those who do not understand well, because Malik, may God have mercy on him, said:
To say whoever said: It is what it was told? He said: No, then he said: The vision is part of prophethood, so it is not tampered with
On Prophethood) Encyclopedia 22/14.
And if a Muslim sees in his dream something hate, then let him seek refuge in God from its evil, and from the evil of Satan, and let him escape three times, and not tell anyone about it, because it does not harm him, and if he sees what he loves, then he must praise God Almighty and happen to it.
For his saying, may God bless him and grant him peace, about what al-Bukhari reported on the authority of Abd Rabbo bin Saeed, he said: I heard Abu Salamah
He says: I was seeing the vision and you got sick, until I heard Abu Qatada say: I was seeing the vision
## The good vision
: (The good vision is from God, and if one of you sees what he loves, only he who loves will happen to it.) Narrated by Al-Bukhari
 And it was reported that the Prophet said: When the time approaches, the believer’s vision is no longer a lie, and the believer’s vision is part of six and forty-four parts of the Prophet. And in a narration: I believe you with a vision: I believe in a hadeeth.
 Al-Bukhari (6989) narrated from the hadith of Abu Saeed, and Muslim (2263) from the hadith of Abu Hurairah
On the authority of the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, he said: “A righteous vision is part of the six and forty-six parts of the prophethood.”
Another narration was mentioned in the counting of Juzan al-Propheth, see “Fath al-Bari” (12/363).
## who interprete dreams
Accordingly, the committee does not consider anyone to profess the interpretation of dreams for a fee or without a fee, because that was opened
It is a door to enter the sorcerers and pretenders, and there is nothing wrong with telling the vision to a mentor who improves the expression of the vision
If the person responsible is like that, and he was asked about the interpretation of a vision, and he saw in it a good thing, that the vision is reassured and good news for it
